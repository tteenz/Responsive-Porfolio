      Hello! My name is Tina and I am a part of the UC Berkeley Boot Camp program. Our program started on
      September 8th, 2018.
      <br>
      <br>
      I was born and raised in San Jose although I hope to move someday to Seattle or possibly San Diego.
      I love all things Disney even though my first time ever going was a year ago! I love the fall and
      the cold so I'm super excited for October to come around.
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm short, but always full of energy...most time anyways. I love to hike, but also love eating all
      sorts of food. I love going to the wilderness because nature is beautiful. I love going to the
      beach to listen to the sound of the waves.
